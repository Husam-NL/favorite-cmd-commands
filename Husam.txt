3 bash commands I have use:
Echo: is a command that writes its arguments to standard output. 
Syntax is echo "text" > file.txt

Cat:   The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard
     output. 
Syntax is (cat file-name)


Ls:List directory contents.
Syntax: ls directory-name
